# harmony-demo-movies
Demo project showcasing a variety of component types built with Bit Harmony

To run the project:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Bit Harmony installed on your computer - [installation instructions](https://harmony-docs.bit.dev/getting-started/installing-bit)
1. The installation process will tell you at the end what the binary alias for bit harmony is for CLI commands - usually it's `bit` (unless you have a legacy version already installed, then it's most likely `bbit`)
1. in the root of this project, run `bit install` (or whatever your bit Harmony alias is) and then when that finishes, run `bit compile`. Dont worry if there's an error in either of those - known issue, if it goes away when you run `bit compile` again then it's just something we need to deal with better.
1. Once the above commands pass, run `bit start` to start the local dev server and UI. Then navigate to the localhost address in the terminal once the server is ready
