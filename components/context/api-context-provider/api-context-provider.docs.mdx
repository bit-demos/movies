description: A context provider to wrap an app that wishes to use the react-request-hook api provider
labels: ['api', 'context', 'provider', 'axios']

This API provider wraps the [React Request Hook](https://github.com/schettino/react-request-hook)  (credit to [Matheus Schettino](https://github.com/schettino))
for ease of use in applications which want to create an api provider based on that hook.

The API provider takes in an axios instance as the API gateway (the hook works with axios only) and creates an api context which can be consumed 
down the component tree by anyone who subscribes to the context.
