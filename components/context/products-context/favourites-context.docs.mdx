#### Overview

This bit component demonstrates the ability to deconstruct react context code, and create a generic factory for creating specific contexts - in this case favourites context for `TItem` type.

For example, using this component you can create Favourites contexts, with all the expected functionality of a favourites context such as add/remove functions, for any type of 
website. So with this component you could create a Movies Favourites component (or just add a context directly in your application) with Movies as `TItem`, and then also 
create a Books Favourites for a separate book retail site or sites. 

Includes functions for managing favourites:
1. `AddToFavourites` - function for adding to the favourites 
1. `RemoveFromFavourites` - function for removing item from the favourites

Also exposes the `favourites` object for accessing the current state of the favourites data.
