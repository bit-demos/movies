description: A movies search micro front end component.
---

import { MoviesSearch } from './movies-search';

The movies-search micro front-end component allows you to search for movies and display the results in a grid with their title and the poster of the movie.

This is a concrete example of composing together multiple component types into a single, uncluttered micro front end, with its own data fetching capabilities, via
the api context hook component, and UI display via the Movies Card Grid component. The entire code for this component is 8 lines long (excluding import statements).

It uses the [use-search-movies](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/movies/movies/data/hooks/use-search-movies) hook for processing the search request, 
and displays the results using the [Movie Card Grid](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/movies/movies/ui/movie-card-grid) UI component.

See composiions for a basic example of the MFE in action:

```js live
< MoviesSearch />
```
