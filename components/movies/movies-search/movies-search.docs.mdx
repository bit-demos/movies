import { MoviesSearch } from './movies-search';

The movies-search micro front-end component allow you to search for movies and display the results in a grid with their title and the poster of the movie.

It uses the [use-search-movies](https://bit.dev/teambit/movie-demo/movies/data/hooks/use-search-movies) hook for processing the search request, and displays the results using the [Movie Card Grid](https://bit.dev/dell/cet/movies/ui/movie-card-grid) UI component.

See composiions for a basic example of the MFE in action:

```js live
< MoviesSearch />
```
