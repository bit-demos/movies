The useSearchMovies hook demonstrates a ***react hook as a bit component***.   
It makes use of an api hook factory component, to enable quick production of this
 api hook, in which all that's required is   
 a) on the provider side, to set up the base url and any fixed parameters for the api call  
 b) on the consumer side, to set up any dynamic parameters, as well as a function to process the data that returns from the api call.


This specific api hook enables searching through the www.omdbapi.com's movies database via their API, and returns data in the form of 
our [internal Movies data model](@learn-bit-react/movies.models.movie).

The hook returns four items for managaing the API calls:
1. getMovies - the function for actually searching movies
1. movies - the result of the movie API call
1. isLoading - true while the getMovies function is waiting to populate the movies variable
1. error - holds any errors returned by the API call

So usage of the hook is like so:

```js
const [getMovies, movies, isLoading, error] = useSearchMovies();

// Some function to call getMovies, show isLoading until it's been reset to false, and then fetch movies data
```

Note: the base Url for the API call is set via the component's Bit environment, and is configurable via the workspace.json file
