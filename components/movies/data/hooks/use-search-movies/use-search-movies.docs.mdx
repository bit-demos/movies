The useSearchMovies hook enables searching through the www.omdbapi.com's movies database via their API.

The hook returns for items for managaing the API calls:
1. getMovies - the function for actually searching movies
1. movies - the result of the movie API call
1. isLoading - true while the getMovies function is waiting to populate the movies variable
1. error - holds any errors returned by the API call

So usage of the hook is like so:

```js
const [getMovies, movies, isLoading, error] = useSearchMovies();

// Some function to call getMovies, show isLoading until it's been reset to false, and then fetch movies data
```

Note: the base Url for the API call is set via the component's Bit environment, and is configurable via the workspace.json file
