import { Movie, mockMovieList } from '@learn-harmony/movies.models.movie';
import { MovieCard } from './movie-card';

The movie-card displays the title and the poster of the movie. It also stores the movie's ID to get more info from the API.

An example that shows the title and the image of a movie:

```js live
() => {
  const movie = Movie.fromApiObject(mockMovieList[0]);

  return <MovieCard movie={movie} />
}

























```
