import cs from 'classnames';
import { PrimaryButton } from '@learn-harmony/movies.base-ui.button';
import { primaryPalette } from '@teambit/base-ui.theme.color-definition';
import { altTheme } from './index';

This alternate theme is provided as an example of how to create multiple themes which are compatible with your themeable css.

It's a simple component - at the moment, all it contains are alternate values for a sub-set of the variables defined in [bit's base theme](https://bit.dev/teambit/base-ui/theme/theme-provider)
with relatively stark differences to illustrate the theme switching (the alternate colour scheme is not recommended...).

For instance, here is the same component with basic bit theme (applied as the default theme by the theme-context component)...

```js live
    <div>
        <div className={primaryPalette}>
        <PrimaryButton >Regular theme</PrimaryButton>
        </div>

    </div>

```

... and with the alternate theme defined here.

```js live
    <div>
        <div className={altTheme}>
            <PrimaryButton>using theme defined by ThemeContext</PrimaryButton>
        </div>
    </div>

```
