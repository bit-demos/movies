import cs from 'classnames';
import { altTheme } from '@learn-harmony/movies.theme.alt-theme';
import { PrimaryButton } from '@teambit/base-ui.input.button';
import { ThemeContext } from './index';

This theme context component is for wrapping component groups or even entire apps in a 'context' in which a theme is provided which acts on CSS classes for which the theme is aimed.

In this case, the default theme provided by this Theme Context component is a [bit's base theme](https://bit.dev/teambit/base-ui/theme/theme-provider).
The theme can be overriden by providing an alternate theme to the Theme Context component

For instance, here is the same component with and without the theme context.

```js live
    <div>
        <PrimaryButton >Regular theme</PrimaryButton>
    </div>

```

```js live
    <div>
        <ThemeContext palette={altTheme}>
            <PrimaryButton>using theme defined by ThemeContext</PrimaryButton>
        </ThemeContext>
    </div>

```
