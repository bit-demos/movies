import cs from 'classnames';
import styles from '@teambit/movie-demo.styling.bootstrap-override';
import Button from '@teambit/movie-demo.base-ui.button';
import { ThemeContext } from './index';

This theme context component is for wrapping component groups or even entire apps in a 'context' in which a theme is provided which acts on CSS classes for which the theme is aimed.

In this case, the default theme provided by this Theme Context component is a [basic bootstrap-compatible theme](https://bit.dev/teambit/use-case-examples/theme/base-theme).
The theme can be overriden by providing an alternate them to the Theme Context component

For instance, here is the same component with and without the theme context.

```js live
    <div>
        <Button >no theme, basic styling</Button>
    </div>

```

```js live
    <div>
        <ThemeContext>
            <Button className={cs(styles["btn"], styles["btn-primary"])}>using theme defined by ThemeContext</Button>
        </ThemeContext>
    </div>

```
