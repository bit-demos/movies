## Overview

A standard React development environment for building and rendering modular and reusable MFEs.

### Usage instructions

Create a **variant** in project's `workspace.jsonc` file.  
Set this extension as the variant's environment, for instance for the variant "any components in the 'ui' namespace":

```json
{
   "teambit.workspace/variants": {
     "{ui/**}": {
       "learn-bit-react.movies/extensions/with-preview-react": {}
     }
   }
}
```

### Theming
This environment adds the design theme [Theme](https://bit.dev/teambit/use-case-examples/design/theme-context) to all compositions of the components that use this example env.

### Data fetching
This environment can configure the bit.dev/local UI API gateway for all compositions by default.
You configure your API by adding a default config in the .aspect.ts file, and then applying the config inside the value object when applying 
the environment to components via workspace.json (see Usage Instructions above)

### Compilation
By default, Component compilation is done with the TypeScript compiler. Target format is `ES2015` which
supports execution from both NodeJS and browser runtimes for server-side rendering.

### Testing
Component testing is done through [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) with the default configuration from the `teambit.react/react` environment, and some overrides which are in the jest/jest.config.json file in this environment 

### Extend
This component development environment can be easily extended. Just add the env as a dependency of your extension
and use the extension API.
